Record labels are under increasing pressure to generate the next big success. Most corporations value-producing outstanding music, but creating music that no one will listen to is futile. After all, record labels want customers to buy CDs, tickets to performances, and merchandise. The music industry relies on much more than just skill to attract listeners. That's why so many music labels use data analytics to decide which songs will appeal to a wider audience.

Some may be surprised to learn that in today's music industry, it's not just about having great skill. It's also about how many people a musician can persuade to buy their albums. The music industry has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. The desire for a larger market share by record labels is, therefore, understandable. They cannot, however, rely solely on the whims of their artists in order to do this. In order to maximize their revenues, they require something more tangible, something that will aid them in better understanding the shifting tastes of the general audience in music. As a result, the use of data science becomes necessary.

On Spotify's website, all songs are scored in the following categories (from the Spotify API documentation,

Mood: Danceability, Valence, Energy, Tempo
Properties: Loudness, Speechiness, Instrumentals
Context: Liveness, Acousticness
The data I will be using comes from these Kaggle datasets:

First, I will see how popular songs stack up against the rest of the collection. Sorting by "popularity" could do this.

I'll then look at the relationship between distinct musical patterns' individual features.

Also, I'd like to do a comparison between the pre-and-post-90s eras.

Would like to create a visualization of popular artists.

Using the most popular songs' audio elements as a starting point, we can then look at the lyrics for a subset of those songs.

Would be really interesting to see patterns in the trends of music that were in different eras and what made them a hit.
